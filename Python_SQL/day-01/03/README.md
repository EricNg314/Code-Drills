# Assemble Avengers!

It's time for the Avengers to assemble. One problem though, *spoiler alert* Thanos made most of them disappear, so we're gonna have to bring them back into existence. In this exercise you will get more practice creating classes and objects in Python as well as calling methods on that class. 

**Hey Mr. Stark I am feeling good... _about classes in Python_**

## Instructions

* Create a class `Avenger` and initialize it with name, enemy, location, and catchphrase
* On this class create a method called `assemble` that simply prints the string "Avengers Assemble!"
* Create another method called `info` that prints all the Avenger's information
* Create the first Avenger: Captain America! by creating a new instance of the class
* Call the methods for Captain America
* Create an additional Avenger, preferrably Thor. Call his methods as well
* Create a while loop that will allow you to continuously create new instances of Avenger using input().
* Keep the loop going until the user specifies otherwise.
