# import Flask and jsonify from flask module.


# Create the variable "app" and set it to the function of Flask with a variable of __name__ as it's parameter


# Create a dictionary called "my_info" with the following information:
  # A key of "my_name" with the value of "Farley"
  # A key of "city_state" with the value of "San Francisco, CA"
  # A key of "age" with an integer value of 10



# Using the route method from Flask, create a root route that provides a list of routes:
  # "/name"
  # "/city"
  # "/age"
  # "/all"




# For each route, return the value associated with the route.
  # The "all" route should return the entire dictionary.





# Run the app to create local session.
