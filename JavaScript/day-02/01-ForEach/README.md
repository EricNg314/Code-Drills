# Iterating/Modifying Through Elements using forEach
## Premise
We'll be serving a group of people at a restaurant. The people's hunger and happiness will be affected by various events.

## Purpose
Using [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) method in JavaScript, we will iterate through an array of objects and modify the information stored in each object.
