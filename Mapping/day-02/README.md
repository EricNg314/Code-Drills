# Meteorites

Every year the Earth is hit with thousands upon thousands of meteorites. Usually an asteroid will fly by and a little chunk of it will descend onto Earth. However only the bigger meteorites are recoreded and named. NASA provides historical data of larger meteorites that have made landfall all over the world.

Using leaflet.js, d3, and leaflet market clusters, plot each meteorite returned from NASA on the map.
* Each meteroite should have a pop up when clicked detailing its name and the year it fell
* The markers should be a different color and/or design than the default marker
* The map should be dark
* The markers should cluster when zoomed out, and become individual markers as the user zooms in

Your finished map should/can look something like this...
