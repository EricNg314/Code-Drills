//========================= Chart 1 =====================================
// Create an object called data with the keys of "date" and "gdp" as empty arrays.





// Parse through each object in the realGDP array that was imported from data.js




// Create the first trace using date and gdp from the parsed variable "data"
  // trace should have a name and a random marker color of your choice.

  

  

// Create an array called chartData. 
  // Add the first trace to the array.


// Create an object called "chart1Layout".
  // For the layout, add a title, x and y axis labels

  






// Add the new plot from chartData and chart1Layout to the element you created earlier with the id "plotID1"



// ========================= Chart 2 =====================================
// ========================= Harder Challenge =====================================

// Only plot the lastest 10 observations from your data.
  // Would recommend reviewing ".length" property and ".slice()" method.
    // for arrays to manipulate your data variable.

    





  

// Your new trace should include a line and marker for each data point.
  // Only 1 trace should be displayed with the name "GDP"

  // The points should have the following attributes:
    // Color of red
    // Have a larger size preferably 20
    // The symbol should look like an "X"
    // Needs to be partially transparent

  // The line should have the following attributes:
    // Color of blue without specifying the word "blue"
    // A thicker line with the value of 3
    // Use dots instead of a solid line

    










// Plot the new trace onto the element you created earlier with the id "plotID2"
