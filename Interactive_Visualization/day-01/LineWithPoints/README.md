# Fun Plotting!

In this activity, we're making a simple line and pretty chart including line/points (definition of pretty... is up to you)!

## Instructions

* Review the `index.html` and complete the comments.
* Review `data.js` to understand the original json structure.
* Have fun making plots within `plots.js`!

When you are done, feel free to update with additional stylings as you review documentation at "https://plot.ly/javascript/".

## Hint

* Review inclass material and documentation. The documentation contains various examples to help with the first challenge. Avoid jumping to the second chart without going through the first.
