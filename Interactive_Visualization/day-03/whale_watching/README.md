# Whale Trackers!
Whale watching is a great way to pass time especially when you're near the ocean. So we'll be looking at an api to retrieve whale sightings and storing it in our database for plotting.

Or what if people decide to use our application and expand the database of whale sightings worldwide?! Endless possibilities...


## Instructions:
1. We've given you the [index.html](unsolved/whale_watching_app/templates/index.html) in the templates folder to relieve some stress.
2. Update [app.py](unsolved/whale_watching_app/app.py) and [data_query](unsolved/whale_watching_app/data_query.py), review the "TODO" comments for expected outcomes. We've provided some hints often commented as "NOTE"
3. Update [app.js](unsolved/whale_watching_app/static/app.js), this file will be creating your map.
4. Finally fill out the following files and deploy your app (preferably Heroku):
   * [Procfile](unsolved/Procfile)
   * [requirements.txt](unsolved/requirements.txt)
   * [run.sh](unsolved/run.sh)
