# Scary Space Rocks
There's a lot of stuff in outer space, and you might find your favorite flying asteroid moving a hundred times faster than Earth's rotation. Hopefully it wont land on our tiny planet with such extreme speeds.

Maybe you can help give everyone some relief by providing visual data about your favorite asteroid.
