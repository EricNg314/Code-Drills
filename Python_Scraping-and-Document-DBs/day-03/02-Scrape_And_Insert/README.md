#02-Scrape_And_Insert

## Premise
We all love reading the news! However, we don't want only local news nor do we want international news. We're only curious about our specific state.

Who wants to go through the trouble of visiting a website everyday for articles and navigating through that page? Instead lets bring the news to us by automatically pulling that data!

## Instructions
1. Start by creating routes in app.py using flask.
    * Render the html template to confirm.
2. Create your scrape function in scrape_news.py 
    * Add the results to your mongo database.
3. Update the html so that your app.py root route will render your query results.
