# Plotting Linear Regression

In this exercise you'll be learning to create a simple chart containing a data points and linear regression based on real data of frozen desert production between 1972 to 2018.

## This includes:
  - Using pandas, numpy, scipy's linregress, and creating a chart area with matplotlib
    - Summarizing data based on year using pandas
    - Separating the data to be applied for charts.
    - Use scipy's linregress to calculate the fit line.
    - Setting up the chart and plotting the data.
      - As well as adding a linear regression line to your data.
