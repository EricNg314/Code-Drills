# Oppan CSS Style

Heeeeeeey, sassy lady! I'm sure everyone remembers the South Korean viral dance craze from 2012. No? Just me? Ok. What Despacito passed it as most viewed?? Anyways...

In this exercise you will get more experience styling HTML content using CSS. Become a worldwide sensation after perfecting your CSS skills to the max. You will be given and very bland and boring HTML page and will need to spruce it up, give it some `gangnam style`

## Instructions

* First, create a link to the external stylesheet
* Change the font for the entire page by targeting the `body`
    * eg. Arial, Helvetica, Georgia, Comic Sans (please don't...)
* Give the section a unique ID and give it the following properties:
    * a `width` of 800px
    * a `background-color` that is light gray
* Center the `h1` headings, change their color to blue, make them bold and increase the font size
* Insert an image of Psy (You can find them on Google)
* Change the color and font size of the first paragraph **and only this paragraph**
* Change the `h2` heading to a different font, make it bold, and increase its font size to 30px
* Change the list bullet styles so that they are an open circle
* Italicize the last paragraph and align it to the right

When all is said and done, you should have something that looks like this -

**Daebak** that means awesome in Korean.

## Bonus 

Let's spice it up even more. Make it really *gangnam style*...

* Give the section some padding and rounded corners
* Align the section so that it is centered horizontally on the page **you cannot use** `text-align: center` 
* Find the youtube video for `Gangnam Style` and embed it under the image
* Create a class called `center` that will center align both the image and video. Again **you cannot use** `text-align: center`
  
If you've managed to tackle the bonus challenges your page will now look something like this -
